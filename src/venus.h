/* 
 * Some basic info about Venus. It is designed to combine some of the features of a game engine, such as Unity or Unreal, and
 * the features of a toolkit, like GTK or Qt. There isn't any particular reason I decided to do this. I wanted to try my hand
 * at making a 2D renderer that I could use to make GUIs, but I also wanted to try to make a 3D game engine, so I thought I
 * might as well combine the two into a single, fluid library.
 * 
 * The features of the game engine are mostly found in the /engine subdirectory and the features of the general toolkit are 
 * mostly found in the /toolkit directory (no surprises there, eh?).
 * 
 * The game engine is not simply a game engine, however. It has a physics engine built in, but that is not necessary. Its
 * primary purpose is as a three-dimensional game engine but I felt that that was a bit constricting. So instead, its main
 * purposes are listed below.
	
	- 3D graphics engine
	- 3D game engine (essentially a renderer plus a physics engine)
	- 2D graphics engine (for example, it could render a chess board and pieces)
	- 2D game engine
	
 * The engine can be used either as a widget on a panel or it can take up the entire window. In either of these cases, normal
 * widgets can still be rendered on top of the display as a GUI. The look and feel of the widgets is customizable as well.
